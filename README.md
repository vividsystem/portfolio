My personal portfolio website built using [`solid-start`](https://start.solidjs.com);
## Features
* automated project page -> fetches all my repos automatically. also supports filtering by topics (like software, hardware)
* the other stuff you would expect from a portfolio site like: about me and contact
* very cool and fancy cursor (desktop only)
* full mobile-support
## Deploying
```bash
bun run build
bun run ./.output/server/index.mjs
```
